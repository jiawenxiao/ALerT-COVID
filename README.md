 
The code is used to build four models to predict the future cumulative CCPM (Confirmed Cases per Million) for the countries
-----------------------------------  

    
### The tutorial includeds  data,code,model and result.
   
  
### 1、The data folder includes source countries and target countries(which is a sample data).
    The data has been reprocessed, and every country is a file with confirmed cases per million.
          
### 2、The model folder includes pre-trianed source model for model B ,model C and model D  

  
### 3. The code includeds four files, each file is corresspond to a model .


### 4. The result folder includeds the result of mape metrics, all the result is in result file. In addtion,the prediction result for the target countries about the effect of lockdown measures is result_predict.
